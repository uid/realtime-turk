Retainer Model
==============

[setup]:Setup

Setup
-----

*	**Make a settings.py**

	Look at settings.template.py and make a duplicate, settings.py, that fills in information appropriate to your own project and database. Make sure to change the username and add your own AWS keys.

*	**Set up the database**
	
	You can choose between using South (for migrations) or Django's built-in syncdb.  
	
	syncdb:
	```bash
	python manage.py syncdb
	```
	
	You may be asked to create a superuser account at some point.  Go ahead and do so.
	
	South:
	```bash
	python manage.py schemamigration retainer --initial
	python manage.py migrate retainer
	```

*	**Test running the server**
	
	To run in development mode, run the following command:
	```bash
	python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:someport
	```
	
	Go to localhost:someport/admin and login with the superuser account you just made.  This is the standard Django administration interface.
	
*	**Create a ProtoHIT**
	
	ProtoHITs are the primary relational mapping between categories of work that you want to post HITs for, and the rest of the retainer model.  A simple application will probably have just one ProtoHIT which directs turkers to the appropriate HIT page.  More complicated applications might have different ProtoHITs for different stages of the application, and the same retainer server might have a number of ProtoHITs altogether while it hosts different applications that use the retainer API.
	
	ProtoHITs can either be created via the admin interface or via the `retainer/puttask` POST API.  Before you attempt to use this retainer code for anything, you should have at least one ProtoHIT.
	
	Most ProtoHIT fields correspond closely to the normal MTurk API parameters.  Notable differences include:
	
	*	_Worker Locale_: Instead of a complicated expression, just leave this field empty to avoid restricting workers by locale, or put in a single appropriate country/locale code, like 'US', to restrict to a particular locale.
	*	_Approval Rating_: An integer percent, 0 to 100.  0 is special, and indicates that workers should not be restricted by approval rating.  100% would require perfect workers.

*	**(Optionally) Create an API Key**
	
	If you'd like, create an API in the admin interface.  This adds an `apiKey` parameter to all API methods that will guard access to those pieces of functionality.
	
*	**Create a cron job to run cron.py**
	
	cron.py should run every minute.  It periodically posts HITs for active reservations.  A typical crontab entry for this file looks like this: 
	
	`* * * * * /path/to/cron.py >> /path/to/retainer.log 2>&1`
	
*	**Integrate retainer.js into your landing page**
	
	Your landing page is where turkers will be waiting; this can be either the same page as your HIT (but with some content replaced temporarily) or a whole other page that turkers will see until there is work ready for them.
	
	Make sure that retainer.js points at the correct URLs.  These will be specific to your installation.  You should override (aka reassign) `Retainer.hasWork` to do something related to the task you want your workers to do.  `hasWork` is passed an object with a `taskID` property, which will be the same as the `foreignID` of any reservation (WorkReservation) your system makes.
	
*	**Have your application make WorkReservations**
	
	Using the `retainer/reservation/make`, ...`invoke`, and ...`done` APIs, coordinate the lifecycle of your tasks 
	with whatever application(s) of yours that are using the retainer server.
	
*	**Monitor work progress**

	There is an HTML landing page for monitoring the status of current jobs on retainer.  It's a static set of files in `static/status`. 
	
API
---

The following method descriptions explain how to interface with the retainer server so that you can integrate it with your applications.  

---

```
gettask/assignment/<assignment_id>
retainer/gettask/assignment/<assignment_id>
```

Called by retainer.js.  Used to poll to look for new work.

---

```
ping/worker/<worker_id>/assignment/<assignment_id>/hit/<hit_id>/event/<ping_type>
retainer/ping/worker/<worker_id>/assignment/<assignment_id>/hit/<hit_id>/event/<ping_type>
```

Called by retainer.js.  Keeps track of active workers sitting on an accepted assignment page.

---

```
puttask
retainer/puttask
```

**POST Params**

- _json_: A JSON description of the ProtoHIT that should have the following shape:
```
title:String,
description:String,
keywords:String,
url:String,
frame_height:String,
reward:Number,
assignment_duration:int,
lifetime:int,
max_assignments:int,
auto_approval_delay:int,
worker_locale:String,
approval_rating:int
```

- (_apiKey_): Optional access guard.

**Result**

_id_: The id of the ProtoHIT being created.

**Description**

Used to create [ProtoHITs][setup].  The names of the properties in the JSON object correspond to similar MTurk HIT parameters.

---

```
putwork
retainer/putwork
```

_Deprecated_.  Creates WorkRequests.

---

```
putwork/done
retainer/putwork/done
```

_Deprecated_.  Cancels a WorkRequest.

---

```
reservation/make
retainer/reservation/make
```

**POST Params**

- _id_: The id of a ProtoHIT to associate this reservation with. (Basically, this associates a reservation with some specific HIT settings that you've already defined.)
	
- _foreignID_: An ID that can be used to refer to an object in an external database.  This ID is passed to individual worker pages via retainer.js.

- _delay_: A delay, in seconds, before work for the reservation is _expected_ to be available.  Doesn't need to be a guarantee, since this is only (planned to be) used for HIT posting optimization.

- _numAssignments_: The number of workers you expect that it will take to complete the reservation.  Used for optimizing HIT posting.

- (_apiKey_): Optional access guard.

**Result**

_id_: The ID of the newly-created WorkReservation.

**Description**

Creates a WorkReservation.  Indicates that work is incoming, though not necessarily available yet.  Calling 
this method will pre-emptively start posting HITs, though workers will not be directed to the actual task yet.

---

```
reservation/cancel
retainer/reservation/cancel
```

**POST Params**

- _id_: The ID of the WorkReservation to cancel.

- (_apiKey_): Optional access guard.

**Result**

`OK` on success, error message otherwise.

**Description**

Cancels a reservation.  May be useful for when the end-user makes a mistake or an app crashes.

---

```
reservation/invoke
retainer/reservation/invoke
```

**POST Params**

- _id_: The ID of the WorkReservation to invoke.

- (_apiKey_): Optional access guard.

**Result**

`OK` on success, error message otherwise.

**Description**

Indicates that a reservation is now being called upon to supply workers to an incoming task.  

---

```
reservation/finish
retainer/reservation/finish
```

**POST Params**

- _id_: The ID of the WorkReservation to operate on.

- (_apiKey_): Optional access guard.

**Result**

`OK` on success, error message otherwise.

**Description**

Marks a reservation as complete, so no more workers are sent to it.  Different than `cancel` only the way that existing HITs are treated.

---

```
reservation/unfinish
retainer/reservation/unfinish
```

**POST Params**

- _id_: The ID of the WorkReservation to operate on.

- (_apiKey_): Optional access guard.

**Result**

`OK` on success, error message otherwise.

**Description**

Marks a reservation as incompleteâ€¦ this is probably only useful for debugging applications.

---
```
reservation/list
retainer/reservation/list
```

**Params**

- (_apiKey_): Optional access guard.

**Result**

JSON array of serialized WorkReservations. The associated ProtoHITs are included in the serialization.

**Description**

Generates JSON to list current reservations and ProtoHITs.

---
```
reservation/finish/all
retainer/reservation/finish/all
```

**POST Params**

- (_apiKey_): Optional access guard.

**Result**

`OK` on success, error message otherwise.

**Description**

Convenience API to mark all reservations as complete, so that no more HITs are posted or kept active.  Saves $$.
